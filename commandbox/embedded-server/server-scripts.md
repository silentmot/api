# Server Scripts

Server scripts work just like [Package Scripts](../package-management/package-scripts.md), but they only apply to server-related interceptor points, and they go in your `server.json`.  If you have several servers in a folder with their own `server-name.json` files, the server scripts can be different per server.

The interception points which will fire a server script are:

* `preServerStart`
* `onServerStart`
* `onServerInstall`
* `onServerStop`
* `preServerForget`
* `postServerForget`

Read more about when these interception points fire [here](../developing-for-commandbox/interceptors/core-interception-points/).

Configure server scripts like so in your `server.json`:

```
{
    "scripts":{
        "onServerInstall":"cfpm list"
    }
}
```

### Ad-hoc server scripts

Just like package scripts, you can also create ad-hoc scripts for a given server. They are executed with the `server run-script` command.  Define them as additional keys in the `scripts` block.

```
{
    "name" : "My Server"
    "scripts":{
        "myScript":"server log --follow"
    }
}
```

And run them like so:

```
server run-script myScript
```
