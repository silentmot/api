# Starting as a Service

When using CommandBox on a staging or production server, you may wish to start up servers as a service when the OS comes online. The recommended approach is to use the [**CommandBox Service Manager Module**](https://www.ortussolutions.com/products/commandbox-service-manager), which is a commercial module that handles all major operating systems (Linux, Mac, Windows) automatically.

Alternatively, you can manually do so following one of these community guides.

## Windows

## MacOS

Coming soon...

## CentOS/RHEL/Ubuntu  (system.d)

Create a `.service` file

```
nano /usr/lib/systemd/system/mySite.service
```

as follows:

```
[Unit]
Description=mySite Service

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/box server start /var/www/mySiteAPI/server.json
Type=forking

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Start the service

```
systemctl start mySite.service
```

Give the service about a minute to load up, then check its status

```
systemctl status mySite.service
```

Once you've verified the service is running as expected, enable the service to load at boot

```
systemctl enable mySite.service
```
