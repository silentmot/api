# Package Management

CommandBox functions as a **package manager** which means you can use it to locate and install code packages for you. This gives you a consistent and scriptable method to install the libraries you need in a simple manner.

```
install myPackage
```

By default, the list of available packages is on ForgeBox, our CFML code sharing site. Additional endpoints such as Git, HTTP/HTTPS, and local file/folder are also available. When a package is installed, all of its dependencies are automatically installed for you for quick, easy experience.

You can easily create your own packages and register them on ForgeBox so the whole community can start using them.
