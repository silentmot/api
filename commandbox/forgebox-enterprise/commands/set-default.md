# Set Default

If you want to update your endpoint to be the default one, just do it like this:\
`forgebox endpoint set-default stg-forgebox`

![](../../.gitbook/assets/forgebox-endpoint-set-default.gif)

This will default your endpoint and you will be able to install packages from your endpoint without giving a namespace.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can verify that your default endpoint has changed by executing the list command.
{% endhint %}
