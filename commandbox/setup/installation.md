# Installation

Regardless of where you place the **box** binary, the first time you execute it, a `.CommandBox` folder will be created in your user's home directory and CommandBox will be extracted into that location. If you delete this directory, it will be replaced the next time the CommandBox executable is run.

You can specify a different install location by adding `-commandbox_home=E:\CommandBox` when you run the box binary.

To avoid specifying the commandbox\_home variable every time you can create a file called `commandbox.properties` (case sensitive) in the same directory as the binary, and fill it with this line:

```bash
commandbox_home=E:\\CommandBox
```

The CommandBox home can also be a path relative to the location of the `commandbox.properties` file.

```bash
commandbox_home=../boxHome
```

## Windows

Extract the executable **box.exe** from the downloaded zip file, placing it anywhere you prefer where you can then execute it when needed, such as from the Windows command line/terminal. You can also run it directly Windows File Explorer, where you would just double click on the exe,which will open the CommandBox shell in a new terminal window.

> **Warning** On Windows 10 and above, the first time you try to run via Windows File Explorer an exe that you've downloaded, Windows Defender Smartscreen will popup with a warning that "Windows protected your PC". You will need to choose the offered "More info" link and then the offered "Run anyway" button, to proceed.

> **Hint** When running from the Windows command line/terminal, you can make it so that you can run `box.exe` while you are in any folder (not just the one where you placed it), by simply adding the exe's location to the Windows `PATH` system environment variable. See [http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm](http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm)

When you are finished running commands in the CommandBox shell, type `exit`. Or if you ran the box.exe from within Windows File Explorer, you can just close the terminal window which that opened.

## Mac/ \*Unix

### Homebrew (Mac)

[Homebrew](http://brew.sh) is a great Mac package manager, it can easily install and keep your CommandBox installation up to date (even binary releases), just run the following for stable releases:

```bash
brew install commandbox
```

To stay with current bleeding edge releases use the following:

```bash
brew tap ortus-solutions/homebrew-boxtap
brew install --head ortus-solutions/homebrew-boxtap/commandbox
```

Then run the `box` binary to begin the one-time unpacking process.

Versions will be installed in `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/commandbox`. To switch between versions, you will need to install the new version - either using the bleeding edge tap or the main repo. For example to switch to a (very) old version:

```
brew install commandbox@5.1.1
brew unlink commandbox
brew link commandbox@5.1.1
```

If you are using a tap, and want to revert back to the current stable version

```
brew uninstall ortus-solutions/homebrew-boxtap/commandbox
brew install commandbox
```

If you want to use a `commandbox.properties` file as mentioned above, even though the symlink is added in `/usr/local/bin`, your `box` _binary_ file will be in the `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/commandbox/<version>/libexec/bin/` directory where you should place your `commandbox.properties` file. There will also be a `box` _binary_ in the `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/commandbox/<version>/bin/` directory where you should place the `jre` if you want CommandBox to use a version of Java that is different from your default version reported by `java -version`.

When using Homebrew to install CommandBox you must use Homebrew for any upgrade, minor or major. To upgrade CommandBox with Homebrew:

```bash
brew upgrade commandbox
```

NOTE: If you use Homebrew to upgrade your version of CommandBox it will erase your `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/commandbox/<current_version>/` folder. So before upgrading, take a copy of your `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/commandbox/<current_version>/libexec/bin/commandbox.properties` file to drop back into `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/commandbox/<new_version>/libexec/bin/` before running `box` for the first time after upgrading.

### Manual Installation

Unzip the binary **box** and just double click on it to open the shell terminal. When you are finished running commands, you can just close the window, or type `exit`.

> **Hint** You can place the binary in your `/usr/local/bin` directory so it can be available system-wide via the `box` command in any terminal window.

## Linux apt-get

> **Please note** that if you are running Ubuntu 18.04 or greater, or Debian 8 (Jessie) or greater, it's necessary to have the `libappindicator-dev` package in order to have the tray icon working correctly.

```bash
sudo apt install libappindicator-dev
```

Run the following series of commands to add the Ortus signing key, register our Debian repo, and install CommandBox.

### Stable

( This first install routine also works for the Raspberry Pi. )

```bash
curl -fsSl https://downloads.ortussolutions.com/debs/gpg | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/ortussolutions.gpg > /dev/null

echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ortussolutions.gpg] https://downloads.ortussolutions.com/debs/noarch /" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/commandbox.list

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https commandbox
```

If you do not have Java installed you can install it with the following command.

```bash
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
```

Then run the `box` binary to begin the one-time unpacking process.

## Linux yum

### Stable

Add the following to: `/etc/yum.repos.d/commandbox.repo`

```
[CommandBox]
name=CommandBox $releasever - $basearch
baseurl=https://downloads.ortussolutions.com/RPMS/noarch
enabled=1
metadata_expire=7d
gpgcheck=0
```

Then run:

```bash
sudo yum update
sudo yum install commandbox
```

## Debian Linux manual install

After you have downloaded the `commandbox.deb` file, install it using the `dpkg` command.

```bash
sudo dpkg -i commandbox-debian-1.2.3.deb
```

Run the `box` binary to begin the one-time unpacking process.

## Redhat Linux manual install

After you have downloaded the `commandbox.rpm` file, install it using the `rpm` command.

```bash
rpm -ivh commandbox-rpm-1.2.3.rpm
```
