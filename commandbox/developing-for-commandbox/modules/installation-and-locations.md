# Installation and Locations

A module is nothing more than a folder that contains a `ModuleConfig.cfc` file. The only requirement for that CFC is that it contains a method called `configure()`. Modules can also contain models, interceptors, commands, and pretty much anything else you want to stick in them. As long as they contain a `box.json` in their root, they are also a package, which means they are self-describing, can install dependencies, and can be installed via the `install` command.

## Locations

CommandBox has two default `modules` directories.

* `~/.CommandBox/cfml/system/modules`
* `~/.CommandBox/cfml/modules`

The first is for system modules so you shouldn't need to touch it. All the built-in commands are in those modules, so feel free to check out how they work. All user-installed modules are in the second folder. The `cfml` folder is the "root" of the CommandBox installation, so there will also be a `box.json` created in that folder once you start installing modules via the `install` command.

## Installation

The first way to create a module is to manually create a folder in the `~/.CommandBox/cfml/modules` directory and place your `ModuleConfig.cfc` inside of it. This is the process described in the guide on [creating your first module](./).

If you have a package of type `commandbox-modules` locally, in a Git repo, or in Forgebox, you can install from any working directory. When CommandBox sees the package type, it will change the installation directory to be the user modules folder.

```bash
install /path/to/module
install githubuser/modulerepo
install forgebox-module-slug
```
