# A Little Fun

We believe all work and no play makes you a dull boy (or girl!).  You'll notice the interactive shell has a handful of quotes and tips that show up when the shell starts.  If you have ideas or suggestions for new ones, please send pull requests or let us know.

## ASCII Art Stereograms

If you remember the "_Magic Eye"_ books from your childhood, you'll be pleased to know CommandBox has an ASCII Art Stereogram for every day of the month.  You'll find it hiding inside the `info` command.  The image will change every day at midnight.

If you're not familiar with how to view these, you want to "diverge" your eyes.  This is what happens when you look at something far away and it's the opposite of crossing your eyes.  Start with your face closer to the monitor and looking square on.  Relax your vision and look past the monitor until the image starts to overlap itself (that's your eyes diverging) until the repeated elements match up again (like the clouds above).  Different parts of the image will appear to be different distances away from you. &#x20;

If you can't see it right away, don't worry.  Practice makes perfect and the more you do it, the easier it is.  You'll get the hang of it, we promise!
