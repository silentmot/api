# What's New in 4.3.0

### Task Target Dependencies

For a task that has more than one target (method) you can specify dependencies that will run, in the order specified, prior to your final target. Specify task target dependencies as a comma-delimited list in a `depends` annotation on the target function itself. There is no limit to how many target dependencies you can have, nor how deep they can nest.

```javascript
component {
  
  function run() depends="runMeFirst" {
  }

  function runMeFirst() {
  }

}
```

Given the above Task Runner, typing

```bash
task run
```

would run the **`runMeFirst()`** and **`run()`** method in that order.\

### GZip Compression

The web server in CommandBox is capable of enabling GZIp compression to reduce the size of HTTP responses. To enable GZip compress on your CommandBox server, add a **`web.gzipEnable`** setting in your `server.json` file.

```bash
server set web.gzipEnable=true
```

### Add --simple flag to ls/dir command

When you get a directory listing in CommandBox, you can add the **--simple** flag which will only output the file and folder name without any other information.  This feature was added to compliment the feature below.

```bash
ls --simple
```

### forEach Command

The **`foreach`** command will execute another command against every item in an incoming list. The list can be passed directly or piped into this command. The default delimiter is a new line so this works great piping the output of file listings directly in, which have a file name per line.

This example will find all JSON files in a directory and run the **cat** command against them.

```bash
ls *.json --simple | forEach cat
```

### Java 9/10/11 support

This is still a little experimental since it hasn't gone through full testing, but we upgraded to Lucee 5.2.9.31 in the core CLI which has support for the newer versions of Java.  We've removed the checks that previously preventing CommandBox from even trying to run on versions of Java later than 8 and at first glance it seems to be working though there's been some flakiness on Java 11.  Please help test these later Java versions and remember that if you spin up a server, you'll want to still dial in Java 8 for Adobe CF 2016 and prior and Lucee 5.2.8.50 and prior even if you have the CLI running on Java 9+.
