# What's new in 4.8.0

### &#x20;Cached HTTP Downloads

You can now cache downloads using the HTTP(S) endpoints using the following syntaxes:

```bash
install https+cached://downloads.ortussolutions.com/ortussolutions/coldbox-modules/cbi18n/1.4.0/cbi18n-1.4.0.zip

start cfengine=http+cached://update.lucee.org/rest/update/provider/forgebox/5.3.3.60-RC
```

This will speed up builds.

### Change to Previous Directory

Thanks to a pull request from John Berquist, we've borrowed a Bash and Powershell feature of being able to change back to your previous working directory by typing this:

```bash
cd -
```

### Better Tab Completion

Thanks to more pull requests from John Berquist, you can use file and folder based tab completion when typing native binaries from CommandBox&#x20;

```bash
!foo bar "C:/Program Files/baz/myFile.cf_
```

And tab completion also works better now when typing a quoted string such as a file path that contains a space.  This is a huge timesaver!

```bash
cd "C:/program Fi_
```

### Access to Intercept data in package scripts

Package scripts that are fired from internal interception points, can access any intercept data via environment variables.  This example writes a file into a server home directory when the server starts, using an environment variable to dynamically find the correct path.

```bash
package set scripts.onServerStart="touch \$ {interceptData.SERVERINFO.serverHomeDirectory}/hi.txt"
```
