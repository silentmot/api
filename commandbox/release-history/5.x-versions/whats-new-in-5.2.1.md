# What's New in 5.2.1

There is now a new "forgebox logout" command you can use for testing or just to remove your API token from the local CLI.

```bash
# Logout one user
forgebox logout username

# logout all users
forgebox logout
```

You can change CommandBox's default tab completion to be an inline list that follows your cursor. **This setting requires you to close and re-open the shell to take affect.**

```bash
config set tabCompleteInline=true
```

We've added better debugging information for Server Profiles.  If you add the **--verbose** flag to your server start, you'll be able to see what profile was detected for your server, and what baked-in rules have been turned on as a result.

```

   | âˆš | Setting Server Profile to [development]
   |   |------------------------------------------------------
   |   | Profile set from "environment" env var
   |   | Block CF Admin disabled
   |   | Block Sensitive Paths enabled
   |   | Block Flash Remoting enabled
   |   | Directory Browsing enabled
   |   |------------------------------------------------------
```

We've added a new **Single Server Mode** you can enable in the CLI to make using CommandBox in Docker images easier.
