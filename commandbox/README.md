## CommandBox Manual - Version 5.9.0

![CommandBox](.gitbook/assets/CommandBoxLogo.png)

Welcome to the CommandBox Manual. CommandBox is a standalone, native tool for Windows, Mac, and Linux that will provide you with a Command Line Interface (CLI) for developer productivity, tool interaction, package management, embedded CFML server, application scaffolding, and sweet ASCII art. It seamlessly integrates to work with any of [Ortus Solutions](http://www.ortussolutions.com/products) \*Box products, but it is also open for extensibility for any ColdFusion (CFML) project as it is written in ColdFusion (CFML) using our concepts of CommandBox Commands.

## Versioning

CommandBox is maintained under the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org) guidelines as much as possible. Releases will be numbered with the following format:
