# Loading Ad hoc Jars

If you need to use a 3rd party jar, we recommend you use the extra parameters to the createObject() function, which allows you to specify a list of jars to load from (this is a Lucee-specific feature).  Read up on the `context` parameter here:

There are some scenarios however that don't work.  One is if you need to use the `createDynamicProxy()` BIF to create CFC instances that implement Java classes that exist in an ad hoc jar.  Lucee currently requires those classes to be loaded by the Lucee system classloader. &#x20;

As such, CommandBox gives you a mechanism to load jars into the system class loader that was used to classload Lucee so those classes are available everywhere.  This is a much better and portable solution to dropping the jars in the `~/.CommandBox/lib` folder and restarting the shell.

## classLoad()

To load up your custom jars on the fly, call the `classLoad()` method which is available in any custom command or Task Runner.

```javascript
classLoad( 'D:/amqp-client-5.1.2.jar' );
```

You can pass either an array or list of:

* D**irectories** - All jar and class files will be loaded from each directory recursively
* **Jar files** - Each jar file will be loaded
* **Class files** - Each class file will be loaded

Note, paths need to be absolute when you pass them in!  Here's some more examples.

```javascript
classLoad( 'C:/myLibs,C:/otherLibs' );
classLoad( [ 'C:/myLibs', 'C:/otherLibs' ] );
classLoad( 'C:/myLibs/myLib.jar,C:/otherLibs/other.class' );
classLoad( [ 'C:/myLibs/myLib.jar', 'C:/otherLibs/other.class' ] );
```
